Protocol:

	The planned protocol is to have a UDP datagram for each packet 
received from the TUN device ( see https://github.com/kc9zda/cattun ). This
program will use the cattun program (see above). The program will send traffic
to the last address:port it has heard a specific byte from (see Pairing). 
Until it receives the special pairing byte, it will silently drop all packets
that it receives. UDP datagrams received on a port other than the one paired
with will also be silently dropped.

Pairing:

	To pair with the program, all one needs to do is send a one byte 
datagram to the UDP port passed to the program. The byte to pair is 0x9F. The 
program will respond with the byte 0xA8.

Arguments:

	usage: udprelaytun <tun dev name> <udp port> <cattun location>

	example: udprelaytun tun99 12345 ../cattun
